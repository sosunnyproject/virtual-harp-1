# Virtual Harp
- HackCooper 2016 October (hosted by Cooper Union NYC)
- So Sun Park, Brendan Whiting

## Idea
- Playing music without much hassle of weight/immobility of real instrument
- Brendan, a keyboard player at Broadway, shared real-life struggle: when players are located in separate booths or stage area, they sometimes miss the right timing to start the music. 
- Contributing to the development of remote/virtual musical instruments, as most of them are expensive and uneasy to just dabble and try out.

## Tools
- Unity
- Leap Motion
- Musical note sound generator
- Maya
